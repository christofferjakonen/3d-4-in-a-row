Project to make a 3 dimensional 4-in-a-row game

game.py file does nothing at the moment and is not used, but the plan is to migrate a lot of functions to this file in the future

working to a degree, now to make it presentable

todo in order of importance (will probably change with time):
1. make it look not bad (includes, but not limited to, make objects in the application window scale when the window is re-sized)
2. score keeping
3. figure out how to make a 3d model in tkinter to use as an alternetiv to current overview of the game board
3. AI player 2?
4. online play?
