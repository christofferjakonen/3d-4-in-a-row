Project to make a 3 dimensional 4-in-a-row game

game.py file does nothing at the moment and is not used, but the plan is to migrate a lot of functions to this file in the future

working to a degree, now to make it presentable

todo in order of importance (will probably change with time):
1. add some kind of overview to make the board state clearer for the players
2. refine window layout and general looks
3. score keeping
4. AI player 2?
5. online play?
